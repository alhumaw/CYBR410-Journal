# Introduction - Alexander Moomaw

- This journal aims to track my learning progress in the art of cybersecurity defense. 

- Here, I will have daily writeups of the material I have learned each day.

- Ultimately, the goal is to create a "handbook" of sorts that I can always come back to when I need it.
