#### Dynamic Webserver
- our idea is to have a MTD environment that utilize kubernetes clusters and a proxy to display content using different web servers. The idea is that the attackers will have a hard time finding a foothold on our server because they won't be able to find a vulnerability that works because the web server type is constantly changing
- **Stretch goals:**
	- Dynamic port hopping to add another layer of defense
	- Dynamic Operating system to add another layer of MTD if they choose that attack surface
