### 1 - MITRE ATT&CK FRAMEWORK
- Describes the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may take to infiltrate and exploit an environment.
- #### Credential Access
	- This section describes the methods that attackers can use to steal credentials.
	- This is applicable to all environments that have some sort of authentication system.
	- ###### Methods of Defense
		- Defending against credential access methods involves securing communication standards, rotating passwords, and logging all authentication access.
- #### Privilege Escalation
	- This section describes how attackers may be able to elevate their privileges on an environment to gain more access than they already obtained by an initial foothold.
	- This is applicable to all environments that have some sort of authentication system.
	- ###### Methods of Defense
		- Defending against privilege escalation really just requires a secure method of multi-factor authentication, consistent updates on software, enforcing strong password policies, and monitoring network traffic.
- #### Exfiltration
	- This section describes how attackers can retrieve data from an environment with which they already have obtained a foothold in. The goal for attackers is for this action to ideally be done without being detected.
	- This is applicable to all environments that have a system for storing valuable data.
	- ###### Methods of Defense
		- Having a proactive approach to exfiltration attempts would be the best method. Making sure that the attackers cannot gain a foothold inside of your environment to begin with would be the best form of defense. This would involve having some sort of secure design implementation by following the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) cybersecurity framework. So, doing things like multi-factor authentication, logging systems, and enforcing least privilege ensures the lowest possible risk of this attack occurring. 
		- However, if the attacker has gained access to our environment, the best form of detection and defense is to catch it through robust logging systems and data loss prevention tools (DLP).

### 2 - Cgroup stuff
- #### Find the cgroup of a program running in a docker container.
	- To find the cgroup of any program, we need to find the PID of the process we're interested in:
		- `ps aux`
		- In our case, we're interested in our docker container, which is currently running a web server using python
			- Currently running processes can be found the `/proc` directory. Inside that `/proc/<pid>` directory there is a `cgroups` file that displays the currently attached cgroup:
				- `cat /proc/<pid>/cgroup`
			- ![[Pasted image 20240422123816.png]]
	- **Is it different than a program running in the normal userâ€™s space?**
		- This can easily be found out by just checking a processes cgroup that is running in our userspace. We'll use top as an example:
			- ![[Pasted image 20240422124153.png]]
			- We can see that the cgroup is different.
	- **Does docker utilize cgroups?**  
		- Docker does utilize cgroups. This is the fundamental aspect of containerized environments that allow for segmented resources.

- #### How do the namespaces in a containerized program compare to that of the same user? (hint lsns)  
	- Does docker utilize namespaces? Which one?
