#### Tell me if your group is integrating iptables.  
- Our group is utilizing IPTables to block IP addresses that attempt to connect to our open FTP server that is hosted on our host machine. This is used to proactively block bad actors who may have NMAP'd our server and found that port open.
- We have a script via TCPDump that records IP addresses connecting to the server on port 21, and also have a bash script that blocks those IP addresses.
