## Update me on what you’ve done for your lab.  
- We were able to get into our server and install our nginx proxy which I thought would have been the largest hurdle.
## Let me know what still needs to be done and who’s responsible to get it done.
- We still need to implement logging through TCP dump, this is to be done by Brenden
- We still need our frontend complete, this is the job of Beighlor and Dillon
- We need our container set up, this is done by Beighlor and Andre
- We need our security system installed, TBD by Cameron.
## Tell me who the most helpful person in your group is.  
- Dillon has been the most helpful with troubleshooting frontend and container issues.
## Pick 2 IDSs and tell me a bit about them (preferably open source).  
-  **Snort:** This is an IDS that utilizes rule-based logging to detect abnormal traffic and also sends alerts to users about this traffic. This tool can also be used to debug network traffic as it has a great logging system. 
- **Suricata:** This is another IDS that provides real-time protecton against various threats. With Suricata, users are able to hunt for threats proactively by investigating live data returned by this tool. 
- I choose Suricata just because I'm more familiar with the tool that Snort. After doing some research, it seems like Suricata also supports multithreading while Snort does not. For a small company I think it really is just up to the users preference.
