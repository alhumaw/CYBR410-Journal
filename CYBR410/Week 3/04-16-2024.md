## **Questions**
- How to list docker containers that are running. 
	- `docker ps`
- How to list all docker containers (running or not). 
	- `docker ps -a`
- How to delete a docker container. 
	- `docker rm <container_id>`
- How to delete a docker image. 
	- `docker rmi <container_id>`
- How to start a docker container in the background (i.e., “detached”). 
	- `docker run -d <tag>`
- How to get a shell in a docker container currently in the background. 
	- `docker exec -it <container_id> bash`
	- This command opens a shell for us in a container that is currently running
- How to make a port available (i.e., make a container port accessible to/from the host).
	- To make a port available, we only have to use the -p flag:
	- `docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <tag>`


**Create a docker file that will:**  
- `vim Dockerfile`
- Pull a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, apline, arch, etc.).  
	- To pull any distribution, we only have to use it's distribution name.
	- Generally we can be pretty simple. In this case, we just use `ubuntu`
		- `FROM ubuntu`
- Install a package not there by default.  
	- To install packages, we will use the `RUN` prefix:
		- `RUN apt update -y`
		- `RUN apt install python3 -y`
- Put a file into the container that is on the base system.  
	- To put a file into the container, we will use the `COPY` prefix:
		- `COPY . .`
			- Place everything in our current directory into the container's current directory
- Run a program upon starting the container.
	- We are going to start an HTTP server using python using the `CMD` prefix:
		- `CMD ["python3", "-m","http.server", "8000"]`
