### What is the most interesting thing we covered so far?  
- **cgroups** has been the most interactive, enjoyable topic that we have covered so far. Really enjoyed learning how we can create resource constraints on processes dynamically. It was cool to be able to see your changes happen in realtime by monitoring things like IO usage.

### What is the least interesting thing we covered so far?
- Nothing has been particularly uninteresting to me. Overall, the **chroot** section was bland to me but only because I already had experience with the topic so it wasn't all that intensive compared to the other topics. I enjoy learning something new all the time.
