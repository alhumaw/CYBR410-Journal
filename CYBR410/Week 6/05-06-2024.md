### What is a honeypot (from a cybersecurity perspective)?  
- A **honeypot** is a purposefully vulnerable service that aims to mimic a real environment to capture data on what methods adversaries might take to attack the server.
- **What services they mimic**
	- A honeypot can mimic any service that the host might want it to. Namely, it can do things like have an FTP server running, host a vulnerable web server, or have a telnet server up.
- **How they are used**
	- They are used by segmenting it into it's own networking environment, then allowing any incoming connections to access the service.
- **What they find**
	- The data that they find is pretty dependent on what we're looking to retrieve. If we want to find the most common attack vectors of an emulated environment, we might retrieve statistics on the most common exploitation method.
- **Are they defense or offense (give me your reasoning).**
	- I would consider honeypots to be defensive. We aren't actively attacking anything, we are just setting up a purposefully vulnerable server to collect data.

## Progress Made on midterm project
- So far, we have our proxy server running through flask. We also have both our Apache and Lighttpd server running behind a load balancer on kubernetes. The next step would be to set up our NGINX kubernetes cluster, combine them onto a single server, then place our proxy in front of the three load balancers.
