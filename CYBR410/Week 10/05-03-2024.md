### Tell me what you did to prepare your server.  
- I worked from home and did not get the chance to prepare on this day. Overall, I built the kubernetes/nginx proxy environment with the built-in WAF that will detect and block common web exploitation methods.

### Tell me what your group needed to finish for your lab 8.  
- From what I could gauge based on their discord messages, it seems like they worked on getting the logging situation fixed such that they could be prepared for the attack happening on Tuesday.
