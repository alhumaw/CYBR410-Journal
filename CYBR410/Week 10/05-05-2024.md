**What is your favorite topic we covered this quarter?** 
- Kubernetes and containers in general was pretty awesome. Super good skill to learn and it was fun learning it as it was all hands on.

**What is your least favorite topic we covered this quarter?**
- My least favorite topic this quarter was the big deployment. I think 7 people per group is too much, 4 should be the max. Getting deeper into logging before this task would also be much more beneficial.

**What tool do you think will be the most useful?** 
- Docker for me personally will be the most useful for creating my own personal projects that can now be portable.

**What do you think we should have covered in more depth?**
- Deeper into Kubernetes. This should just turn into a complete containers and orchestration  class. All three months, just containers. Big deployment? containers. Logging? containers. MTD? containers. Daily reports? written in containers for each week and the image is turned into canvas for review.
