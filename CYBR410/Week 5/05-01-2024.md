#### How I would change the default “Access denied” page. 
- IN: `rddr/rddr-proxy/rddr/proxies/static/denied.html`
- You can modify the contents of  `denied.html` to whatever we choose.
#### Why there are not separate deployment and service files?
- Instead of deploying the clusters individually, kubernetes can process multiple clusters and services in a single YAML file. The only restriction is that pods have to be in their own config file and services have to be in their own config file.
#### Why is there an input request proxy and an output request proxy? 
- The **input proxy** replicates incoming data to multiple instances to detect malicious intent.
- The proxy diffs the response to ensure the data lines up, making sure that there is consistent, intended behavior.
- The **output proxy** collects the multiple responses and merges them into one for the microservice architecture.
#### What line allows you to go to http://localhost:31001/ instead of the way you accessed pages before?
-  The `rddr-frontend` cluster ip will allow you to go to that same location. This is the front end of the website where traffic initially comes from: `http://10.152.183.145:2123`
#### How do you delete a deployment/service without the yaml configuration files?
- For a deployment: `kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>`
	- `dvwa1 dvwa2 dvwa3 mysql rddr`
- For a service: `kubectl delete service <service-name>`
	- `dvwa1 dvwa2 dvwa3 dvwasql rddr-frontend rddr-mysql-proxy`
