### Task: Generate an SSH key
- #### SSH Defined
	- SSH gives us a way to connect remotely to another computer/server via the command line interface
	- The server must be 
		- Running the SSH service
		- Open and listening for connections on a port (default is 22)
- #### Common SSH Authentication Methods
	- There are different methods to authenticate with SSH
		- **Password-based authentication**
			- To connect to the server, we utilize a username and password to log in
		- **Key-based authentication**
			- To connect to the server, we perform authentication using keys (*asymmetric encryption*)
			- To generate our keys, we utilize the ssh-keygen service. This is a component of the SSH service that gives us the ability to create two keys...
- #### Key-based Authentication (cont.)
	- **Public Key**
		- This key will be given to the computer/server we connect to 
	- **Private Key**
		- This key will be used on our end to authenticate from our computer against the public key that is on the server
- #### Generating the Key
	- ``` ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 ``` 
		- *-t*: select an algorithm
		- *-b*: select a key size
