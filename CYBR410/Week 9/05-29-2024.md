### Tell me how easy it was to deploy your lab 7 infrastructure.  
- Deploying our infrastructure was overall not too strenuous. I followed a couple online resources to set up the WAF and proxy, and the kubernetes cluster was super easy to set up.

### Explain if this was the best way, or if there is a preparation you would have rather made.
- I believe this is likely the best way to get this exact environment set up. I don't see any easier solution to this infrastructure topology.
