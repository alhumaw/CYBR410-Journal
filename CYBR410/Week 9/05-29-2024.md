### Tell me how easy it was to deploy your lab 7 infrastructure.  
- Deploying our infrastructure was overall not too strenuous. I followed a couple online resources to set up the WAF and proxy, and the kubernetes cluster was super easy to set up. The setup process generally involves first setting up docker and kubernetes, attaching an external nginx proxy to our host machine, then configuring our proxy to route traffic to our kubernetes load balancer.

### Explain if this was the best way, or if there is a preparation you would have rather made.
- I believe this is likely the best way to get this exact environment set up. I don't see any easier solution to this infrastructure topology.
