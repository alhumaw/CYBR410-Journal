#### Tell me what you did to test another group.  
- To test another group, I ran an NMAP scan to perform reconnaissance:
	- `nmap -A -T5 10.102.67.11`
- This command returned ports 22, 80, and 2222.
- Connecting to port 2222 returned chatgpt that was emulating an SSH connection. I attempted to break out of the prompt but it didn't return any results.
#### Examine the logs for your deployment and tell me if you can see anything.  
- I missed the opportunity to examine the logs before the server was wiped, but the logs would have shown attempted connections on port 21 from our TCPDump logs. We also would have seen a ton of WAF logs coming from our ModSecurity firewall. Things like SQL Injections and Cross-site scripting attempts would have shown up on our logs.
#### Define ransomware.  
- **Tell me how one can defend against ransomware.**  
- Ransomware is a type of malware that attempts to encrypt victims' data in order to receive money to decrypt it. The best ways to defend against ransomware would be to proactively back up data that would be targeted by a ransomware attack. Having active training sessions for employees to teach them how to detect phishing attempts also is important.
